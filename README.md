Code Challenge For Job Interview

Didn't get this all done as it was quite a big project.
Would have liked to added Room to persist the data and branched the repo units to net or local.
I've added some open ends to save the images locally with the Base64 code.
There's also some unused code in case you want to download the images and convert them straight to Base64 to display and save them in the onlineData class.
Would have also used dagger to persist the data objects in the App class to make it easier to deal with screen rotation.
Displaying all the images on the details fragment would have been a bit of an overhead as I would have had to create dynamic view arrays for the icons
I've done a basic details page but not complete.

If you want to give me more time, I'll add these things and re-push later.
